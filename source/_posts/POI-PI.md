Let me show you...

Pi

The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and this

is just the beginning. It keeps on going... forever.

Without ever repeating.

Which means that contained within this string of decimals

is every single

other number.

Your birth date,

combination to your locker,

your social security number...

It's all in there... somewhere.

And if you convert these decimals into letters,

you would have every word

that ever existed in every possible combination.

The first syllable you spoke

as a baby,

the name of your latest crush,

your entire life story from beginning to end,

everything we ever say or do...

all of the world's infinite possibilities rest within this one

simple circle.

Now what you do with that information...

what it's good for...

well that would be up to you.
